TypedQuery macros use `__elixir__()` for query generation\n2. `__elixir__()` creates ERaw nodes - opaque strings in AST\n3. Haxe generates `this1` sentinel for abstract method chaining: `var this1 = nil; this1 = expr; this1`\n4. AST transforms can't see inside ERaw - EFnTempChainSimplifyTransforms is blind to it\n5. When ERaw is multi-line, `sanitizeArgPrinted()` wraps in string-level IIFE\n6. Cleanup passes already ran on AST, so they never see these string-level IIFEs\n\n## Example of Problematic Generated Code\n```elixir\ndefp load_todos(_user_id) do\n    TodoApp.Repo.all((fn -\u003e\n      query = Ecto.Query.where((fn -\u003e query = Ecto.Query.from(t in TodoApp.Todo, [])\n      this1 = nil      # \u003c-- WARNING: unused\n      this1 = query\n      this1 end).(), [t], t.user_id == ^(user_id))\n      this1 = nil      # \u003c-- WARNING: unused\n      this1 = query\n      this1\n    end).())\nend\n```\n\n## Solution: String-Level Cleanup (Quick Win)\nAdd post-processing cleanup in ElixirASTPrinter.hx after IIFE wrapping.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- src/reflaxe/elixir/ast/ElixirASTPrinter.hx - Add string cleanup in sanitizeArgPrinted() or new helper\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- No this1 warnings in todo_live.ex, user_changeset.ex, user_controller.ex\n- npm test passes\n- mix compile --force shows no this1 warnings\n\n## Effort: 2-3 hours | Impact: Fixes ~6 warnings immediately","notes":"Reopened (was closed by mistake; pending work + verification).","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-03T22:03:07.790546-06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T07:35:52.357098-06:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T07:35:52.357098-06:00","labels":["1.0-roadmap","compiler","post-1.0","quick-win"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"haxe.elixir-qqt","depends_on_id":"haxe.elixir-713","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-03T22:04:41.781971-06:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"haxe.elixir-qqt","depends_on_id":"haxe.elixir-lfq","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-03T22:30:31.33965-06:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"comments":[{"id":26,"issue_id":"haxe.elixir-qqt","author":"fullofcaffeine","text":"No remaining this1 warnings observed.\n- rg -n \\bthis1\\b examples/todo-app/lib returned 0 results.\n- QA sentinel now compiles todo-app with --warnings-as-errors and passes (RUN_ID=1766842283).","created_at":"2025-12-27T13:35:44Z"}]}
