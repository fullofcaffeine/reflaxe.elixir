{"id":"haxe.elixir-6ya","title":"Phase 1.3: Create FinalUnderscorePrefixTransforms - move ALL underscore prefixing to final pass","description":"## Problem\n`_this` is used after being set, which Elixir warns about:\n```\nwarning: variable \"_this\" is unused (if the variable is not meant to be used, prefix it with an underscore)\n```\n\nThe variable has underscore prefix but is still being used later in the code.\n\n## Root Cause\nUnderscore prefix is applied in builders (too early), but usage is detected in transforms (too late).\n\nTimeline problem:\n1. Builder creates `_this` with underscore (assuming unused)\n2. Later code uses `_this` \n3. Transform runs but underscore already applied\n4. Elixir sees underscore-prefixed var being used = warning\n\n## Solution\nMove ALL underscore prefixing to a FINAL sentinel pass that runs after all other transforms.\n\n## Files to Modify\n- src/reflaxe/elixir/ast/builders/*.hx - Remove early underscore prefixing\n- UPDATE: src/reflaxe/elixir/ast/transformers/FinalUnderscorePrefixTransforms.hx (may exist)\n\n## Implementation\n1. Remove underscore logic from all builders\n2. Create/update final pass that:\n   - Scans entire module for ALL variable definitions\n   - Collects ALL variable usages across entire module\n   - Only THEN applies underscore prefix to truly unused variables\n3. Register as LAST pass in transformation pipeline\n\n## Key Principle\nUnderscore prefix decision must happen AFTER all transformations that might add/remove usages.\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should run after: Phase 1.0A (this1 cleanup)\n- Blocks: Phase 1.2 (removal pass needs correct usage data)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- No \"underscore variable used after set\" warnings\n- All truly unused variables get underscore prefix\n- All used variables do NOT get underscore prefix\n- npm test passes\n- mix compile --force shows no underscore-usage warnings\n\n## Effort: 2-3 hours | Impact: Fixes 2 warnings + prevents future issues","notes":"Duplicate/outdated: Phase 1.3 underscore-prefixing work was already completed (see haxe.elixir-2co).

TypedQuery macros use `__elixir__()` for query generation\n2. `__elixir__()` creates ERaw nodes - opaque strings in AST\n3. Haxe generates `this1` sentinel for abstract method chaining: `var this1 = nil; this1 = expr; this1`\n4. AST transforms can't see inside ERaw - EFnTempChainSimplifyTransforms is blind to it\n5. When ERaw is multi-line, `sanitizeArgPrinted()` wraps in string-level IIFE\n6.
