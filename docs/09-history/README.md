# History & Records (archived)

This section contains historical notes and long-form records that are **not** part of the curated,
up-to-date documentation set.

Most content was moved under `docs/09-history/archive/` during post‑1.0 cleanup:

- `docs/09-history/archive/records/` – retrospectives, large task logs, legacy guides
- `docs/09-history/archive/docs/` – older documentation snapshots preserved for reference
- `docs/09-history/archive/sessions/` – development session notes
