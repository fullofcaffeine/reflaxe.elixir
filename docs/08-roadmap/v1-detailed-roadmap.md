# Reflaxe.Elixir v1.0 Roadmap

## Current Achievement: Pre-v1.0 (Substantial functionality complete)

### ✅ COMPLETE: Phoenix & Ecto Ecosystem (Major Achievement)
- **Phoenix 100%**: LiveView, controllers, templates, routers
- **Ecto 100%**: Schemas, changesets, queries, migrations, advanced features
- **Mix Integration**: Build pipeline, file watching, incremental compilation
- **Source Maps**: Debugging support with `.ex.map` generation
- **Basic OTP**: GenServer compilation with `@:genserver` annotation
- **Type System**: Complete Haxe→Elixir type mapping and validation

**Assessment**: 70% of a production Elixir application is covered. Phoenix and Ecto integration is excellent.

## 🎯 TRUE v1.0 Requirements: Essential OTP & Standard Library

### Missing Essential Features (Required for Production)

#### 1. OTP Supervision Patterns ⚡ CRITICAL
**Status**: In Progress (Task ID: `ee441a6d-71d3-4b29-98ba-fb2d2957fc5a`)
- **Supervisor**: Process supervision with restart strategies
- **Registry**: Standard process discovery and naming
- **Task Supervision**: Background work management
- **Why Essential**: GenServers without Supervisors violate Elixir's "let it crash" philosophy

#### 2. Standard Library Extern Definitions ⚡ CRITICAL  
**Status**: Pending (Task ID: `04963e5b-277a-4527-8474-fe059dec3a1a`)
- **Process**: Process management and communication
- **IO**: Input/output operations
- **File**: File system operations  
- **Enum**: Collection manipulation
- **Why Essential**: Cannot build real applications without basic Elixir functions

#### 3. Protocol Support ⚡ CRITICAL
**Status**: Pending (Task ID: `5b7d71b6-450f-42b3-bcea-2e21dc2b113d`)
- **Enumerable**: For-comprehensions and collection iteration
- **String.Chars**: String interpolation and conversion
- **Inspect**: Debug output and logging
- **Why Essential**: These protocols are used throughout Elixir code and Phoenix

#### 4. Type Alias Support 📝 IMPORTANT
**Status**: Pending (Task ID: `956463cd-9fe6-41dd-96d3-125106807e4d`)
- **Typedef Compilation**: Haxe typedef → Elixir type aliases
- **Why Important**: Type documentation and code clarity (standard practice)

## Version Definitions (Clarified)

### v1.0: "Production Elixir Application Ready"
- **Criteria**: Can build, deploy, and run production Elixir/Phoenix applications
- **Essential**: All OTP patterns, standard library access, protocol support
- **Timeline**: 4 essential features above (estimated 2-4 weeks of focused work)

### v1.1: "Developer Experience Polish" 
- **Criteria**: Better tooling, error messages, performance optimization
- **Features**: IDE support, enhanced error messages, compilation performance
- **Timeline**: After v1.0 completion

### v2.0: "Advanced Features & Optimizations"
- **Criteria**: Edge cases, architectural improvements, advanced metaprogramming
- **Features**: Only things that don't block production applications
- **Timeline**: Long-term optimization work

## Effort Estimation

| Feature | Complexity | Estimated Effort | Priority |
|---------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| OTP Supervision | High | 1-2 weeks | CRITICAL |
| Standard Library | Medium | 3-5 days | CRITICAL |
| Protocol Support | High | 1-2 weeks | CRITICAL |
| Typedef Support | Low | 1-2 days | IMPORTANT |

**Total v1.0 Completion**: ~3-5 weeks of focused development

## Success Metrics for v1.0

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Can create supervised GenServer processes
- [ ] Can use Registry for process discovery
- [ ] Can spawn and supervise background Tasks
- [ ] Can use Process.send, IO.puts, File.read, Enum.map
- [ ] Can implement Enumerable protocol for custom types
- [ ] Can use type aliases for documentation

### Production Readiness Tests  
- [ ] Can build a complete Phoenix LiveView app with supervised processes
- [ ] Can handle process crashes with supervisor restart strategies
- [ ] Can use standard Elixir libraries without extern workarounds
- [ ] Can integrate with existing Elixir codebases

## 🏗️ Post-v1.0 Architectural Improvements: Eliminating Technical Debt

### 📌 CodeFixupCompiler Elimination ⚡ IMPORTANT
**Status**: Identified Technical Debt (Extract completed, root cause fixes pending)
**Issue**: CodeFixupCompiler performs post-processing string manipulation that should be fixed at AST compilation level

#### Problems to Fix at Root Cause:
1. **Y Combinator Malformed Conditionals**: Fix compilation to generate correct syntax from start
   - Current: String replacement of `}, else: expression` patterns
   - Target: Proper conditional generation in YCombinatorCompiler.hx
   
2. **App Name Resolution**: Handle @:appName injection during AST compilation, not string replacement
   - Current: Post-processing `getAppName()` → `"AppName"` replacements
   - Target: AST-level name resolution during expression compilation
   
3. **Source Map Integration**: Integrate source mapping into core compilation flow
   - Current: Separate source map writer management
   - Target: Built-in source map generation during AST processing
   
4. **Syntax Cleanup**: Generate clean syntax from start rather than cleaning up artifacts
   - Current: Post-processing empty string concatenation removal
   - Target: Proper expression compilation without artifacts

#### Implementation Strategy:
- **Phase 1**: Identify root causes in YCombinatorCompiler and expression compilation
- **Phase 2**: Implement proper AST-level fixes for each category
- **Phase 3**: Remove CodeFixupCompiler delegation methods one by one
- **Phase 4**: Eliminate CodeFixupCompiler entirely

**Why Important**: String post-processing is brittle, hard to debug, and doesn't scale. Proper AST-level compilation is more robust and maintainable.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Y combinator generates correct conditionals without fixup
- [ ] App names resolved during AST compilation
- [ ] Source maps integrated into main compilation flow
- [ ] CodeFixupCompiler.hx deleted entirely
- [ ] All tests continue passing

## Conclusion

**Current State**: Excellent Phoenix/Ecto foundation (70% of production needs)
**Missing**: Essential OTP patterns that make Elixir production-ready (30%)
**Path Forward**: Focus on 4 essential features above for true v1.0
**Timeline**: Realistic 1-2 months for production-ready v1.0 completion

The foundation is solid - now we need the fault tolerance and standard library access that make Elixir applications production-ready.
