## PRD Guidelines

PRDs in this directory should follow this structure:

1. **Executive Summary** - Vision, goals, and differentiators
2. **Current State Analysis** - What's working, critical gaps, technical debt
3. **Requirements** - Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
4. **Architecture Decisions** - Technology choices with rationale
5. **Success Metrics** - Measurable outcomes
6. **Implementation Roadmap** - Prioritized timeline

## Relationship to Documentation

- **PRDs** define **what** we need to build and **why**
- **AGENTS.md** contains agent instructions and current project truth
- **docs/** contains implementation guides and technical details

## Agent Instructions

For AI agents: All agent instructions are now in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md). Use ACTIVE_PRD.md for current priorities and requirements.
