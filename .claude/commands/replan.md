ok, let's take that issue that into the existing shrimp plan that thinks carefully about a solution,, updating what's needed and then replanning thoroughly, making sure we don't miss any steps until 1.0. Double check the plan with Codex, and add that as
part of the plan: 1) You should let tests drive the development, with idiomatic intetnded results; 2) todoapp will function as a overall e2e test that will also verify that the compiler reaches 1.0 - todoapp
should compile in haxe and elixir without errors and warnings and no runtime errors either; 3) if you get stuck, give codex detailed info and context about the issue and verify its reply to unblock, then replan
in shrimp to reintegrate the solution with this prompt if needed. You should also refer to the git history to make sure you understand what you worked on before, and that you are not duplicating work!
Ultrathink your way to it.
