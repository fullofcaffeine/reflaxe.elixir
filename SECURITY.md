# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently **alpha** quality. Security best-effort fixes may be provided, but
there is no formal SLA.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories:

1. Go to the repository’s **Security** tab
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**
3. Provide reproduction steps, impact, and affected versions

If you can’t use GitHub advisories, open a private communication channel with the maintainer first.
