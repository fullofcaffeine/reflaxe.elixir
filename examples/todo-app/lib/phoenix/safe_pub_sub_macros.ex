    SafePubSubMacros module generated from Haxe

     * Convenience macro for creating application-specific SafePubSub wrappers
     *
     * This will be enhanced in future phases to auto-generate conversion functions
     * and provide even more ergonomic APIs.
     *
     * For now, applications should create their own wrapper classes that use
     * the SafePubSub infrastructure with their specific topic and message types.
