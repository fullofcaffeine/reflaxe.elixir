defmodule EReg do
  @moduledoc """
  EReg module generated from Haxe
  
  
	The EReg class represents regular expressions.

	While basic usage and patterns consistently work across platforms, some more
	complex operations may yield different results. This is a necessary trade-
	off to retain a certain level of performance.

	EReg instances can be created by calling the constructor, or with the
	special syntax `~/pattern/modifier`

	EReg instances maintain an internal state, which is affected by several of
	its methods.

	A detailed explanation of the supported operations is available at
	<https://haxe.org/manual/std-regex.html>
