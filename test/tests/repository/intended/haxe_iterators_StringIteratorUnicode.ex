  StringIteratorUnicode module generated from Haxe
  
  
	This iterator can be used to iterate across strings in a cross-platform
	way. It handles surrogate pairs on platforms that require it. On each
	iteration, it returns the next character code.

	Note that this has different semantics than a standard for-loop over the
	String's length due to the fact that it deals with surrogate pairs.
