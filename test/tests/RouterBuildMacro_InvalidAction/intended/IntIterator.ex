  IntIterator module generated from Haxe
  
  
	IntIterator is used for implementing interval iterations.

	It is usually not used explicitly, but through its special syntax:
	`min...max`

	While it is possible to assign an instance of IntIterator to a variable or
	field, it is worth noting that IntIterator does not reset after being used
	in a for-loop. Subsequent uses of the same instance will then have no
	effect.

	@see https://haxe.org/manual/lf-iterators.html
