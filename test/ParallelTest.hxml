# Parallel Test Runner Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: This compiles to INTERPRETER, not Elixir!
# The ParallelTestRunner is development tooling that runs on the host machine,
# not application code that runs on BEAM.
#
# Why interpreter target?
# - Needs to spawn haxe processes on host machine
# - Needs file system access to test directories
# - Needs to run in same environment as developer
# - This is infrastructure, not application code
#
# Usage:
#   haxe test/ParallelTest.hxml                  # Run all tests in parallel
#   haxe test/ParallelTest.hxml -j 4             # Use 4 workers
#   haxe test/ParallelTest.hxml test=liveview    # Run specific test
#   haxe test/ParallelTest.hxml update-intended  # Update intended output

# Main class
-main test.ParallelTestRunner

# Class paths
-cp test

# Target: Haxe Interpreter (runs directly, no compilation to other language)
--run test.ParallelTestRunner

# Optional: Enable for debugging
-D reflaxe_runtime
