# Legacy Test Configuration File
#
# This file is kept for backward compatibility.
# The test runner has been migrated to Make.
#
# Usage:
#   make -C test                    # Run all tests (parallel)
#   make -C test -j1                 # Run all tests (sequential)
#   make -C test test-NAME           # Run specific test
#   make -C test update-intended TEST=NAME  # Update expected output
#   make -C test help                # Show help
#
# Or using npm:
#   npm test                         # Run full test suite
#   npm run test:sequential          # Run tests sequentially
#   npm run test:single TEST=arrays  # Run specific test
#   npm run test:update              # Update all intended outputs
