# Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

This directory contains Product Requirements Documents for Reflaxe.Elixir development.

## Current PRDs

- **[PRD_VISION_ALIGNMENT.md](./PRD_VISION_ALIGNMENT.md)** - Core vision and architecture requirements for transforming Reflaxe.Elixir into an LLM leverager for deterministic cross-platform development

## PRD Guidelines

PRDs in this directory should follow this structure:

1. **Executive Summary** - Vision, goals, and differentiators
2. **Current State Analysis** - What's working, critical gaps, technical debt
3. **Requirements** - Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
4. **Architecture Decisions** - Technology choices with rationale
5. **Success Metrics** - Measurable outcomes
6. **Implementation Roadmap** - Prioritized timeline

## Relationship to Documentation

PRDs define **what** we need to build and **why**. Implementation details go in:
- `documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md` - How the system works
- `documentation/guides/` - How developers use features
- `documentation/paradigms/` - Conceptual frameworks
